# National Parks Explorer
This National Parks Explorer website was created by
Ryan Sanchez for the Capital One Software Engineering
Summit MindSumo Application.

#####Thank you for the opportunity to learn how to use APIs and create a web app!

###Development & Learning
This was my first time making a webapp that utilizes API calls.
My experience with Web Development has just been basic front-end
HTML and CSS, with occasional basic vanilla JS. 

For this project, I began by trying to figure out what I should use
for development. After attending the first workshop, I began to use React JS.
However, after being swamped with school work, exams, and an Ultimate Frisbee
Tournament for the past three weeks, I was unable to learn enough React to be 
able to create what I had in mind.

So, I decided to switch to using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. Though my experience
with Vanilla JS is very limited, I still had some familiarity with it. I watched videos
and used online tutorials to learn how to use an API and interact with it. 
My completed project is very basic, but it was the most I have been able to complete
in the given timeframe due to my schedule.

###Future Plans for the Project
If I were to do this project again, I would immediately start with using vanilla JS
instead of spending too much time learning an entire skill set. 
I want to use this project to continuously learn web development, and eventually
make a polished version.
